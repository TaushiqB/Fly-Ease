# Fly-Ease
Developed a console-based Airlines Reservation System in C++ that allows users to book flight tickets, manage flight details, and track bookings. The system supports booking tickets for multiple flights, handles user input for name and ticket numbers, and updates flight information dynamically. The project also interacts with a MySQL database.
